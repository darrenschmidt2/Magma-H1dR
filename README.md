# Magma-H1dR
Computes the matrices of the Frobenius and Cartier Operators on H1 de Rham Cohomology of a Z_p tower of curves over P1 totally ramified at one point

To run this file, open magma and type load "h1drComputation.m";

Then call computeH1dR(K,n,d,f) where K is the function field, n is the level of the tower, d is the ramification invariant of the first level of the tower, and f is a polynomial such that y1^p-y1 = f
