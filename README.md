# Magma-H1dR
Computes the matrices of the Frobenius and Cartier Operators on H1 de Rham Cohomology of a Z_p tower of curves over P1 totally ramified at infinity.

To run this file, open magma and type load "h1drComputation.m";

Then call computeH1dR(p,r,d,n,f) for F_{p^r} where p is prime, d is the ramification invariant of the first level of the tower, n is the level of the tower, and f is a polynomial such that y1^p-y1 = f
